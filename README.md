## 🔒 Verified Launch Gate

The repository remains **closed for unverified product intake and publication** until source evidence is validated.

- Product identity, pricing, stock, barcode, and images must be evidence-backed.
- Catalog and inventory validation are mandatory.
- Products API remains locked while source intake is unverified.
- No guessed or placeholder product data should be added to production.
- GitHub Actions CI uses Node.js 20 as the current known-good project runtime.
- GitHub Pages and Supabase are tracked as separate infrastructure blockers.

**Current verification policy:** a green GitHub workflow requires an actual Job and successful Build + Validate steps; a workflow existing without a Job is not treated as successful.
